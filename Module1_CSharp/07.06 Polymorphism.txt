Abstract: behaviours and attributes that every child has to have.
Interface: which methods class has to implement. Every class that implements it can do it in their way.

The difference is that abstract classes can have already implemented methods (that do not change among their children)
If object implements interface, we can use its method: "everybody that implements this class can use this method"
