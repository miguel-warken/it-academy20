- Review of what has been seen until now
- Jagged Arrays: multidimensional arrays that can have different rows and columns lengths;
- fori < col[i].Length <- we use this, since we don't know the Length of each line or colunms

- Jagged: int[][], Multdimensional: int[,]

- Generic types: 95% classes. Previously, we had to foresee what types would go in parameters
	|- With generic types, we can "care less" about that
	|- Checks and assigns a type when compiled
	|- More performance: less boxing and unboxing
	|- Good practice!
	|- Lists (LinkedList generic restricted), Dictionaries, KeyedCollection...
	|- E.g.: instantiating an ArrayList as a list<>
