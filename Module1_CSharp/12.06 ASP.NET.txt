Previously, locally running with dotnet run and build

When going Web, we use ASP.NET: Asynchronous server pages
	|- Infrastructure with many applications
	|- Getting started official docs
	|- MVC: Model View Controller standard, each layer 	meaning one component of the bigger system

- ASP.NET: Organized resource to support applications and support structures

-ASP.NET Core: View: what user sees, Controller: what user interacts with and Model: backedn and rules
	|- Dependency injection standards implementation
	|- Pipeline: automated linked actions

- Integrated c# with .NET, focusing on Web Apps and API's (REST APIs)

- Doc with links and materials

- Only need other resources on runtime, not on compilation

- Bootstrap, dependency injection, pipleline middleware

-Path to endpoint can appear multiple problems

- HTTP: HTML + JS + CSS
	|- HTTP Response status codes: 100-199: info, 200-299: success, 300-399: redirection, 400-499: cliente error, 500-599: server error

- When sending requisiton, some data gets translanted. Google.com -> ip address

Static
-Requisition asks for HTML: server gets that HTML file and others related and then returns the requisition with this as its contente

ServerSide Rendering with dynamic sites

-Views consume the model (application state)
- Business rules generally on model

dotnet new mvc --use-program-main

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
initialization bootstrap: "boot for this web server"

mapControllerRoute: default "values"
